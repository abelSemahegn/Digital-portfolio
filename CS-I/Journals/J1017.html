            <p><b>1:What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</b></p>
            <p><b>1.1:It is "And"(I think)</b></p>

            <p><b>2:What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?:</b> </p>
            <p><b>2.1:</b>I think it is "XOR"</p>

            <p><b>3:What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder? Why is this true?</b></p>
            <p><b>3.1:</b> I noticed compared to all the rows of the half adder is that they outputs are the same.</p>
            <p><b>3.2:</b>it is true because 0 and 1 in both add up to the same number </p>

            <hr>
            <p><b>4:Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?:</b> </p>
            <p><b>4.1:</b>you only need two inputs not three</p>

            <hr>
            <p><b>5:Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?: </b> </p>
            <p><b>5.1:</b>Yes, becuse the out output would also show up</p>

            <hr>
            <p><b>6:Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?:</b> </p>
            <p><b>6.1:</b>You can infer that there would be a third input. The state is called carry.</p>

            <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
            <p>I learned about Binary Adders</p>

            <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
            <p>Trying to understand the consepts</p>
                                                                                              
            <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
            <p>Linking a youtube video that helps us understand the consepts.</p>
                                                                                
            <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
            <p>Going forward i have a deper understanding of Binary Adders.</p>
