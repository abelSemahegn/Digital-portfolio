            <p><b>1:</b>How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?</p>
            <p><b>1.1:</b>It allows diferent out commes in a program</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>2:</b>Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true?</p>
            <p><b>2.1:</b>to show the reaction in the true state</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>3:</b>Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?</p>
            <p><b>3.1:</b>jump is executed to the alternative, otherwise execution continues with the consequent.</p>
            <p><b>3.2:</b>if the first conditional brakes then it will execute</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>4:</b>What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent? </p>
            <p><b>4.1:</b>to catch the false</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>5:</b>Why is there no need for a corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative? </p>
            <p><b>5.1:</b>you cought all relevent cases</p>
