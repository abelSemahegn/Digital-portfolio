       <p><b>1:</b>1 Reddit - Reddit hosts user submited content and when a user looks up a subreddit, Reddit then shows the post in a ranked format set to the user. </h1>

        <p><b>1.2</b> YouTube - YouTube when requested will serve content like videos.</p>

        <p><b>2:</b> It appears that both jack Williams and john williams can have a directory of the same name.
        Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory the same name is
        important? Why?</p>
        <p>
        <b>2.1</b> 
        It's important because when you scale there will be people with same name. so it is better to allow same name.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p> <b>3:</b> Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</p>
        <p><b>3.1</b>It probobly has that so you have a indicator for where you are</p>
        <hr>
         <p><b>4:</b>Did the prompt change? If so, how? why is this useful?</p>
         <p><b>4.1</b>Yes, it did change, it listed the name of the directory after"~". This can be used to oriantate your self in the directory.</p>
         <hr>
         <p><b>5:</b>What happens each time you press the up arrow? What happens each time you press the down arrow.</p>
          <p><b>5.1:</b>It cycles up through your past commands</p>
           <p><b>5.2:</b>If you want to go back in the history than you can press the down arrow</p>
        <hr>
         <p><b>6:</b>Was "Hello, World!"Printed to the before? If, not why not? what do you think happend?what do you think happened to the text?</p>
         <p><b>6.1:</b>No, "hello world" was printed to a file.</p>
         <hr>
         <p><b>7:</b>How does the ls command differ from the 'tree' command? How do you choose to use one over the other</p>
         <p><b>7.1:</b>tree shows file hierarchy. 'ls' does not do that </p>
         <p><b>7.2:</b>use tree to see a quick graph of directory. ls to quickly see files in directory.</p>
        <hr>
         <p><b>8:</b>What do you think the argument to sleep specifies? Are you able to prove your hypothesis?How?</p>
         <p><b>8.1:</b>It sets seconds to sleep</p>
          <p><b>8.2</b>If you were to run the sleep command with any number it will sleep that many seconds.</p>
          <hr>
           <p><b>9:</b>
               How is the behavior different from what you expected?
               What do you think it means to run a job in the background?
               What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?
           </p>
            <p><b>9.1:</b>It doesm't block the foreground. It returns a number.</p>
           <p><b>9.2:</b>When you run a job in the background you dont see it but it is running in your CPU</p>
           <p><b>9.3:</b>it shows the number of jobs running </p>
           <hr>
           <p><b>10:</b>What do you observe as you execute the jobs command? How do you explain your observations?</p>
           <p><b>10.1:</b>Once it finnishes it dissapers </p>
           <p><b>10.2</b>when it completes the timer it dissapers.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</b> That that client/server Model is a framwork that is used everywhere</p>
        <p><b> What Challenges did I encounter?</b>N/A</p>
        <p><b> How could this experience be improved?</b>N/A</p>
